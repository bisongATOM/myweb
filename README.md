# 🎉 JavaScript Interactivity Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and form validation**.  
It is divided into three main parts:

1. **Event Handling** – Listening for user interactions like clicks and key input.
2. **Interactive Elements** – Creating dynamic features (light/dark mode toggle, counter, FAQ accordion).
3. **Form Validation** – Validating form inputs using custom JavaScript logic.

## 📂 Files in this Project
- `index.html` → The main structured web page.
- `style.css` → Styles for layout, theme, and interactivity (optional but included).
- `script.js` → JavaScript logic for event handling, interactivity, and validation.
